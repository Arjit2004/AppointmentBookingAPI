This is a simple API, which just has one end-point to book appointmnets. 
It will accept time of appointment in 24-hour format (e.g.: 13:05) and a name.

If the appointment booking is successful, then a booking id will be provided as confirmation.
Otherwise, a messgae would be displayed to inform the user of the reason, due to which the appointmnet couldn't be booked.
